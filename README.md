FigPro is an innovative, real-time collaborative design platform inspired by Figma. Built using **Next.js** and powered by **Liveblocks**, it enables seamless teamwork on design projects with multiple users working simultaneously.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same design, with instant updates visible to everyone.
- **Vector Editing**: Tools to manipulate shapes, lines, and text to create complex designs.
- **Version Control**: Track and revert to previous design versions seamlessly.
- **Interactive Workspace**: An intuitive design interface with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **User Activity Tracking**: See what others are doing in real-time with user annotations and highlights.
  
## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Liveblocks
- **Design Tools**: Custom-built components for vector editing, text formatting, and UI elements.

## 🌟 How It Works

1. **Start a Design**: Begin a new project or collaborate on an existing one.
2. **Invite Collaborators**: Share a link and start working with your team in real-time.
3. **Edit and Sync**: All actions are immediately reflected for all users.
4. **Version Control**: Manage your design history and revert changes if needed.
